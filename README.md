# Planumex (PEX)
## Whitepaper Version 1
### November 22nd, 2018






















# Introduction
Planumex is a decentralized cryptocurrency aimed to be the primary blockchain for interplanetary commerce and use. Created on 11/19/2018 as a hard fork from the NXT Blockchain at block height: 2112952. Forking the NXT chain has allowed Planumex to create a solid foundation we can build upon. NXT already has a lot of features we needed to utilize to obtain our vision of a interplanetary blockchain. One of the most important features built into the Planumex (PEX) Blockchain is the ability to create assets and other tokens on our chain. This will allow for existing communities to build upon the PEX protocols and API. It is also important to understand that most cryptocurrencies and blockchains are not capable of interplanetary transactions due to block generation times and overall lack of wifi or internet technology advancement. Planumex as a solution that will solve these primary problems with an entire community of forward thinking individuals to accomplish such a feat. Our primary goals are to partner with Satellite providers and owners to become one of the first “Satellite Nodes” on the Planumex Blockchain. This will allow us to begin testing and communicating with a node in space. If we are unable to acquire any partnerships that align with our vision we create in house Satellites or Satellite solutions that can be attached to Satellites before launch. Planumex (PEX) will not stop until our vision of an interplanetary cryptocurrency has been achieved.

## Current Problems Facing Interplanetary Transactions
One of the primary problems current cryptocurrencies have that are a PoW model is transaction and block time. If you are sending a transaction from space when you are synced to the chain at say block 12893 and initiate that transfer depending on block size and confirmations of your transaction may not reach another node in time before the next block generation. Meaning that your btc will be returned and the transaction will never make it into that block. 

Profitability mining in space: For example as interplanetary travel become more mainstream thanks to Elon Musk and other great inventors of our time. There will be a surge of space mining, due to lower temperatures, and large consumption of solar energy to be acquired in space. However due to the above referenced problem, mining in space again will not produce any blocks into the chain because of an enormous amount of latency and lag. Thus any miners in space will be at a significant disadvantage and will be almost useless.

Another important point is the utility that each of these cryptocurrency has created. There is not one cryptocurrency that is center around an interplanetary consensus system that allows for governance across potentially the entire universe. Majority of these chains at this large of a scale would require more than 10 million gigabytes of data in just a few years. For an interplanetary chain to really work it needs to be lean and have not only a small energy footprint but also an extremely small data footprint as well.



## Solutions for an Interplanetary Blockchain
Creating the Planumex (PEX) Blockchain has allowed for us to edit and change certain settings within the primary core of the chain. Planumex is a Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrency that relays on communication between nodes to confirm blocks, transactions, voting, and other features within the Planumex Blockchain. The PEX chain uses a unique method to update transactions within blocks incase of a delay or longer than usual transaction. NOTE this does not allow for an account to double spend as each node has public key balances updated with every block. Which in turns means that it knows if account XXX has already sent PEX from a previous block height and will decline the transaction.

The Planumex Blockchain does not using any mining algorithms. However using a Proof of Stake consensus model that rewards those that are forging on a public facing node. This in turn reduces the need for large amounts of energy and “mining farms” to produce transactions or block rewards for those transactions.

The primary utility of the Planumex (PEX) blockchain is to allow for interplanetary transactions or commerce. We have designed our blockchain in a way that would allow for easy connection and storage of data across vast amounts of space. Each block is a total of only a few gigabytes and will slowly grow to 1mb as more transaction are conducted. Our goal is to also have a longer block time to allow for more confirmation to be included in each block. Transaction confirmation are separate from block confirmations. Each transaction will receive a confirmation that it has been received or sent and a final block confirmation to include within the chain.

How Satellite Nodes Communicate
The below diagram has been provided by NASA and shows a great example on how each of these Satellite Nodes will communicate with each other via IP to IP or Peer to Peer.

As you can see from the above diagram the nodes connected with red lines are acting as the primary service nodes on the Planumex Blockchain, these nodes than relay the chain to other nearby nodes on various planets or within space itself. 

# Planumex (PEX) Coin Information
Planumex is a Proof of Stake cryptocurrency below is the technical information regarding the coin including total supply, circulating supply, ports, and more. 

## PEX Specifications
PEX – Cryptocurrency with proof-of-stake (POS) forging
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 PEX
Circulating Supply: 300,000,000 PEX
Each PEX is divisible to 10^8 NQT (8 decimal places)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-256
Encryption Algorithm: Curve25519
Block speed: 1 Minute
Transactions per block: 256
Max attachment size: 42K
POS difficulty is recalculated every two block
POS reward: only transaction fees

## PEX Port Numbers
API Port: 1358
Primary Port: 1756
Testnet Port: 9354

The port numbers are important to us and resemble a meaning. For example the motion to enter 1358 is similar to a launch arrow or to go. The API port is a clockwise forward moving motion. The testnet is a way to go back in time or reverse.

# How to Create a PEX Wallet

Creating a Planumex (PEX) Wallet is fast and easy to do. At the time of writing this the preferred method is to do the following: 
You can also watch this informative walkthrough video on installing the Planumex Wallet. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyjzN4TiQ4Q

First you will want to clone or download the Planumex Blockchain here: https://github.com/Planumex/Planumex-Blockchain

Download and install the following required programs to connect:


Java JDK 8: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
Java JRE 8: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
Nodejs LTS: https://nodejs.org/en/ 
 
 
 
 
## Launch the Planumex Wallet
After you have downloaded and installed the required prerequisites, continue by downloading this GitHub repo to your desktop or computer. You can also clone or fork this project as well.
Navigate to the downloaded and extracted folder called Planumed-Blockchain-Master:
Windows: Open the run.bat file and connect to the Planumex Blockchain
Ubuntu/Debain: Open terminal in folder and run sh ./run.sh
MAC: Open terminal in folder and run sh ./run.sh
Next you will be able to login or create a new wallet account. You will be presented with the desktop wallet if running on windows or you can also view in your favorite browser by visiting: http://localhost:1358/index.html
